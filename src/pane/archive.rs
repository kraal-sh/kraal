//! A pane's history in two parts. The emulator keeps the newest rows, a couple of screens of
//! them, at full width; the archive keeps the older lines, compact (see `history.rs`). Output
//! moves rows from the first to the second as it pushes them up: the parser hands them to a
//! thread that encodes them (see `store.rs`). Resizing reflows only what the emulator holds.
//!
//! Rows move only above everything in use: the view, the selection and the copy-mode cursor, with
//! a screen to spare. Both parts together hold no more rows than the pane's scrollback, as the
//! emulator alone did, and at least all but what the emulator holds of its own at most (a couple
//! of screens and a batch).
//!
//! A flood of output, more rows within a second than the scrollback holds (or than the archive
//! keeps up with), stays in the emulator as it would without the archive (most of it goes before
//! anyone looks), and moves to the archive once the output pauses.
//!
//! When the view, the copy-mode cursor or a search goes above what the emulator holds, archived
//! lines are laid out again, at the pane's width then, above the emulator's rows: a [`Lens`] on
//! the archive, which keeps them. It holds the lines around the view only: far back (the top of
//! the history), the lines between it and the emulator's rows are laid out once the view reaches
//! them. It goes when the view comes back down. Command marks are found on the history whole: the
//! lines between are laid out for them, and become the emulator's own.
