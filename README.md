kraal runs in the terminal you already use: panes, tabs and workspaces that keep running when you
close the window. It also knows what each pane is doing: the server it is
on, the branch, whether that server is production, the agent working there and whether it is
waiting for you.

- **Never hunt for the stuck agent.** Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini and 26 others are
  marked working, blocked or done, in the sidebar and on their pane, with a desktop notification.
  Those running in kraal on your servers are listed too. `alt+a` jumps to the next one that needs
  you.
- **Several agents on one repository.** Start an agent in its own worktree and branch, then
  review, commit, open a pull request or merge without leaving kraal.
- **Named Claude and Codex accounts.** See reported usage, choose accounts per project, and
  change an agent pane's account with an Undo action. Claude can continue a verified conversation;
  changing Codex accounts starts a new one. [Accounts and limits](docs/agents.md#accounts)
- **Your servers, one key away.** Add a server explicitly, or review a discovered connection
  before saving it. Open one, or a whole group in a grid; type in all of them at once; copy files
  between any two; keep tunnels open.
- **Production looks like production.** A pane on a production server, cluster, Terraform
  workspace or AWS profile gets a red frame, and kraal asks before broadcast typing or a
  multi-line paste lands there.
- **Tools where you are.** lazygit, k9s, htop or the logs open on the focused pane's server or in
  its directory. `ctrl+b o` labels every link, path, commit or pod on screen, to copy or open it.
- **Runbooks that stop at the first failure.** Procedures kept as files run server by server
  after showing their plan, and log everything. Your Markdown docs run block by block.
- **Close the terminal, keep working.** Sessions keep running when the window closes or the
  connection drops. Workspaces keep their layout automatically, including after Close, and
  Delete offers recovery. After a reboot, kraal restores saved layouts and available scrollback;
  [resume rules](docs/workspaces.md#what-resumes) determine which programs restart.
- **One binary, any modern terminal.** Linux and macOS. The kitty keyboard protocol (Shift+Enter
  reaches Claude Code), images in panes (kitty graphics and sixel), shell integration, the mouse.

## Install

```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vodhash/kraal/main/install.sh | sh
```

Or, with Rust 1.88 or later:

```sh
cargo install kraal
```

The script takes the [prebuilt archive](https://github.com/vodhash/kraal/releases) for your
machine (Linux and macOS, x86_64 and arm64), checks its checksum and installs into
`~/.local/bin`. To update later, `kraal update` for the script's install, `cargo install kraal`
again for Cargo's. [More ways](docs/install.md)

## Quick start

```sh
kraal
```

This starts a session, or attaches to the one already running. Press `ctrl+b` and let go: a menu
shows what each next key does. `ctrl+b w` opens Workspaces, `ctrl+b s` opens Servers,
`ctrl+b a` starts an installed agent, with named accounts for Claude and Codex. Use `ctrl+b A l` for Accounts
and **+ Add account** if none is listed. Each management list has **+ Add**; search only filters.
The bar at the bottom shows what can be done in the focused pane, and its keys.

To leave, `ctrl+b d` detaches: programs keep running, and `kraal` brings you back where you were.
`ctrl+b q` quits: programs stop, and the layout is saved for the next `kraal`.

kraal reads each agent's state from its screen. To get exact states from the agent itself, install
its hooks once (here Claude Code; `kraal integration status` lists the others):

```sh
kraal integration install claude
```

## Keys you can guess

<img src="assets/menu.png" alt="The ctrl+b menu: one letter per theme, its capital for the theme's menu" width="720">

After `ctrl+b`, a theme's letter runs its main action and the capital opens its menu: `s`
connects to a server, `S` shows everything about servers. The same letters mean the same thing in
every menu (`n` new, `x` close, `e` rename). Shortcuts work on any keyboard layout, and every command
and every menu can move to the keys you want.
[Keys](docs/keys.md)

## Workspaces kept automatically

Open Workspaces (`ctrl+b w`), choose **+ Add workspace**, give it a name and select **Add**.
Arrange tabs and panes as you work. **Close** keeps the layout as **Closed**; **Open** brings it
back. **Rename** changes its name in kraal, never a file. **Delete** moves it to **Deleted
workspaces**, where **Restore** brings it back closed, even after a restart.

KDL files are reusable startup layouts. Save the following as `shop.kdl`, then use
`kraal import ./shop.kdl` to preview and add it. Shells can start; imported commands and agents
wait for Enter. Export a copy with `kraal export ./shop-copy.kdl --workspace shop`.
Neither operation is needed to keep your workspace, and exports contain no conversations.

```kdl
layout {
    cwd "~/src/shop"
    tab name="release" {
        pane split_direction="vertical" {
            pane command="ssh" { args "deploy@web-prod-1"; }
            pane split_direction="horizontal" {
                pane agent="claude"              // Claude Code, on the account the rules pick
                pane preview="CHANGELOG.md"      // a live Markdown preview
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Made to be scripted

Every pane knows its session, so scripts and agents drive kraal from inside it:

| Command | |
|---|---|
| `kraal run --right --name tests -- cargo test` | a new pane; prints its id |
| `kraal wait -p api --until blocked,done` | until the agent in "api" needs you |
| `kraal exec @prod -- uptime` | on every server of a group, in parallel |
| `kraal events agent.blocked pane.failed` | what happens, as JSON lines |

`[hooks]` runs a command on any event: ping your phone when an agent is blocked, log every SSH
connection to production. [Scripting, events and hooks](docs/scripting.md)

## The name

A kraal is an enclosure for cattle, in southern Africa. Servers are cattle, not pets, and now
agents are too.

## Status

kraal is young. Linux is used every day; macOS passes the whole test suite on every release but
nobody uses it daily yet; Windows is not supported. Known gaps:

- Images in panes and previews need a terminal that draws kitty graphics with Unicode
  placeholders (Ghostty, kitty) or sixel (foot, WezTerm, Konsole, Windows Terminal…); elsewhere
  their cells stay blank, and previews use half blocks. Over sixel, an image that output scrolls
  shows again once it stays put, and never on the window's last row.
- Agent states come from hooks for Claude Code and eight other agents, and for what Gemini CLI's,
  Codex's, Cursor's and Augment's hooks tell; otherwise they are read from the screen and can lag.

Bug reports and ideas are welcome in the [issues](https://github.com/vodhash/kraal/issues).

## Development

The unit and end-to-end tests, which also check these pages against the program (every command
line, key, setting and example they quote):

```sh
cargo test
```

On Linux, the idle-worker tests count thread context switches to detect polling. The measured
workers block signals so unrelated process activity cannot look like polling. These tests send
SIGCHLD during the measurement and check that real work still wakes the workers afterwards.
